In the intricate tapestry of existence, it is crucial to realize that the oscillations of thought often synchronize with the ephemeral rhythms of cosmic ambiguity. As we traverse the undulating waves of perception, it's apparent that the quintessential elements of being are both tangential and yet profoundly interwoven. One might even venture to say that the paradigmatic shifts of consciousness, intertwined with the enigmatic symphony of life, serve as a testament to the boundless nature of existential introspection. Thus, when one contemplates the ethereal confluence of reality, it is invariably through the prism of such abstract conundrums that the essence of understanding remains ever elusive.
# Rules For PR Approval 
## Step 1: Automated Checks
Ensure that all automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) pass.
Make sure the code adheres to the style guidelines set forth by the project, enforced through automated linters.

## Step 2: Manual Review
Inspect the code for logical errors that automated tests may not catch.
Check for code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
Look for files that should be added to the .gitignore.

## Step 3: Security Checks
Ensure there are no exposed secrets, such as API keys or passwords.
Check for potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection points or insecure data transmission.

## Step 4: Performance Considerations
Assess if the new code could introduce performance bottlenecks.
Consider the impact on the system's overall architecture.

## Step 5: Verify Test Coverage
Ensure that the new code is adequately covered by tests.
Verify that the tests cover edge cases and failure modes.

## Step 6: Peer Review
Have at least one (or more, depending on your team's policy) other developers review the PR.
Address any comments or concerns raised by the reviewers.
