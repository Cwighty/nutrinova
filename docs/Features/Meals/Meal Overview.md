**Audience**: New Person Introduced to the Project
**Purpose**: Provide a high level overview of the meals feature

In NutriNova, a meal represents a specific instance of food consumption. It links a food item (either a single food or a recipe) to a particular user and records the quantity consumed. Meals serve as the foundation for tracking dietary intake and evaluating progress towards nutritional goals.

### **Recording Meals**

Users can efficiently record meals by selecting from their food library or recipes. Key aspects of meal recording include:

- **Food/Recipe Selection**: Choosing the specific food or recipe that was consumed.
- **Quantity**: Indicating the amount of the selected food or recipe that was eaten.
- **Date and Time**: Specifying the date and time of consumption.
- **Patient (Caretaker Mode)**: In caretaker mode, selecting the patient for whom the meal is being recorded.

### **Viewing Meal History**

NutriNova provides users with a comprehensive history of their recorded meals. This history can be viewed in various formats, such as:

- **Daily Summary**: A quick overview of the foods and recipes consumed throughout the day, along with their corresponding quantities and nutritional information.
- **Detailed History**: A comprehensive log of past meals, including the date and time of consumption, the selected food or recipe, the quantity consumed, and the associated nutritional breakdown.

### **Additional Features**

- **Editing Meals**: Users can modify the quantity or date of previously recorded meals.
- **Adding Notes**: Users can include notes to provide additional context or details about a particular meal.
- **Patient-Specific Views (Caretaker Mode)**: Caretakers can access meal histories and nutritional information for each patient under their care.
