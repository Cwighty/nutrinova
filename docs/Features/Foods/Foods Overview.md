## **Foods Overview**

**Audience**: New Person Introduced to the Project

**Purpose**: Provide a high level overview of the foods feature

NutriNova provides users with a comprehensive food management system, allowing them to efficiently track and manage their dietary intake. The system encompasses both custom-created foods and those imported from the USDA's extensive food database.


### **Creating Custom Foods**

Users have the flexibility to create custom foods that accurately represent the nutritional content of what they consume. This feature is particularly beneficial when a specific food item is not found within the USDA database.

When creating a custom food, users can specify details such as:



* **Name**: A descriptive name for the food item.
* **Serving Size**: The amount that constitutes a single serving.
* **Serving Size Unit**: The unit of measurement for the serving size (e.g., grams, ounces, cups).
* **Nutritional Facts**: The breakdown of macronutrients and micronutrients present in a single serving.


### **Importing from USDA Database**

NutriNova streamlines the process of finding and importing food items from the USDA database. Users can effortlessly search the database by food name, which presents a list of common foods along with their nutritional information.

Once a suitable match is identified, users can import the food item directly into their personal food library. Imported foods can be further modified to align with specific requirements or preferences.


### **Managing Foods**

NutriNova ensures efficient management of both custom-created and imported foods:



* **Edit**: Users can modify any aspect of a food item, including its name, serving size, serving size unit, and nutritional content.
* **Delete**: Food items can be easily removed from the user's library if they are no longer needed.
* **View Details**: Users can access comprehensive details of each food item, allowing them to verify its nutritional composition and ensure it aligns with their dietary needs.
