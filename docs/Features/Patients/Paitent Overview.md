## Patients Overview

**Audience**: New Person Introduced to the Project
**Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview of the patients feature

Patients form the core of NutriNova's user management system. A patient represents an individual whose nutritional intake and goals are being tracked and managed within the application. The system accommodates two primary user flows: single-user and multi-user (caretaker) modes.

### Single-User Mode

In single-user mode, the user is both the patient and the individual managing their own nutritional data. During the onboarding process, users input relevant demographic information, including age and sex, to facilitate personalized recommendations and goal setting. The user's data is treated as belonging to a single patient under their care.

### Multi-User (Caretaker) Mode

Caretaker mode empowers healthcare professionals and caregivers to oversee the nutritional well-being of multiple patients. Caretakers can:

- **Add Patients**: Easily create and manage profiles for each patient under their care, including demographic details and optional profile pictures.
- **View Patient Information**: Access comprehensive information for each patient, including meal history, nutritional intake, and progress toward goals.
- **Record Meals**: Log meals and snacks on behalf of their patients, ensuring accurate tracking of dietary intake.
- **Set Goals**: Establish personalized nutritional goals for each patient based on individual needs and recommendations.
- **Generate Reports**: Create detailed reports that summarize a patient's nutritional progress and goal achievement over specified timeframes.
- **Edit Patient Information**: Modify existing patient profiles, including demographic data and profile pictures, as needed.
