## **Recipes Overview**

**Audience**: New Person Introduced to the Project

**Purpose**: Provide a high level overview of the recipe feature

In NutriNova, a recipe represents a complex food item composed of multiple individual food items or ingredients. Recipes streamline meal planning and logging by allowing users to create and store combinations of foods that are frequently consumed together. This eliminates the need to manually log each individual component of a meal separately.


### **Creating Recipes**

Users can create recipes by selecting from their existing food library or by importing foods from the USDA database. The recipe creation process involves specifying the following:



* **Ingredients**: A list of individual food items that make up the recipe.
* **Quantities**: The amount of each ingredient used in the recipe.
* **Measurements**: The units of measurement for each ingredient quantity (e.g., grams, ounces, cups).
* **Yield**: The total amount of the recipe produced (e.g., number of servings or total volume).
* **Notes**: Any additional information or instructions relevant to the recipe.
* **Tags/Categories**: Optional labels for organizing and categorizing recipes (e.g., "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," "Dessert," etc.).

As a recipe is constructed, NutriNova provides a real-time estimation of its nutritional content, including macronutrient and micronutrient totals.


### **Editing Recipes**

Recipes can be modified without affecting previously recorded consumption history. Users can adjust ingredients, quantities, yield, notes, and tags as needed.


### **Viewing Recipes**

NutriNova offers an organized overview of a user's recipe library. Users can easily search and filter recipes by various criteria, including recently used, most used, and category.

Detailed views of each recipe display the included foods, their respective quantities, the overall nutritional content per serving, and any associated notes.
