## Understanding Nutrient Goal Types in NutriNova

**Audience**: Users of the Nutrinova Goals feature
**Purpose**: Explain the types of goals, what they mean, and how they are displayed

NutriNova helps you achieve your nutritional goals by providing insights into your daily intake of essential nutrients. To effectively use this feature, it's important to understand the different types of goals and how they are presented within the app.

### Types of Nutrient Goals

There are four primary types of nutrient goals in NutriNova, each based on recommendations from the USDA:

- **RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance):** This goal type signifies the average daily intake level of a nutrient sufficient to meet the needs of most healthy individuals. In NutriNova, an RDA goal is displayed as a **minimum target** to reach.
- **AI (Adequate Intake):** When an RDA cannot be determined, an AI is established, representing an approximate intake level assumed to be adequate for healthy individuals. Similar to RDA, an AI goal is presented as a **minimum target** to achieve.
- **UL (Tolerable Upper Intake Level):** This goal type denotes the maximum daily intake level of a nutrient unlikely to cause adverse health effects. In NutriNova, a UL goal is displayed as a **maximum limit** that should not be exceeded.
- **AMDR (Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range):** This goal type specifies a range of intake for macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and protein) associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases while ensuring adequate intake of essential nutrients. In NutriNova, an AMDR goal is visualized as a **target range** with both lower and upper limits.

### Goal Visualization

NutriNova employs a user-friendly interface to visualize your progress towards each goal:

- **Progress Bars:** Each nutrient goal is represented by a progress bar that illustrates how close you are to reaching or exceeding your target or staying within the target range.
- **Color Coding:** The progress bars are color-coded to provide a quick visual cue:
  - **Green:** Indicates that you have met or exceeded the recommended intake for RDA and AI goals.
  - **Blue:** Shows that you are within the target range for AMDR goals.
  - **Red:** Signals that you have exceeded the limit for UL goals.
  - **Yellow:** If you have a custom goal, they yellow line will indicate the USDA recommendation.
-
- **Numerical Values:** The specific numerical values of your consumed amount and target amount/limit are displayed alongside the progress bar, allowing you to track your intake precisely. For AMDR goals, both the lower and upper limits of the range are shown.

### Additional Notes

- You can set custom goals for nutrients that do not have USDA recommendations.
- NutriNova allows you to track your progress over time and generate reports to gain deeper insights into your nutritional patterns.

By understanding these goal types and their visual representations, you can effectively utilize NutriNova's goals feature to make informed dietary choices and work towards a healthier lifestyle.
