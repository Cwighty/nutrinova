## **Nutritional Tracking with Goals Overview**

NutriNova's core functionality revolves around helping users track their nutritional intake and progress towards personalized goals. This documentation will explain key concepts related to goals and nutrients within the NutriNova domain.

### **Goals**

A **goal** in NutriNova represents a daily target for a specific nutrient. Users, or caretakers on behalf of patients, can set these goals to monitor their dietary intake and ensure they're meeting their nutritional needs.

Goals can be set in two ways:

- **Custom Goals**: Users can define their own target values for each nutrient based on their individual needs and preferences.
- **Recommended Goals**: NutriNova leverages demographic information (age and sex) to provide **recommended daily intake values** based on established nutritional guidelines (e.g., USDA recommendations).

### **Nutrients**

**Nutrients** are the essential components of food that our bodies need to function and maintain health. NutriNova allows tracking for a wide range of macro and micronutrients, including:

- **Macronutrients**: These provide energy and are needed in larger amounts. Examples include:
  - Carbohydrates
  - Protein
  - Fat
  - Fiber
  - Sugars
  - Water
- **Micronutrients**: These are needed in smaller amounts and play vital roles in various bodily functions. Examples include:
  - Vitamins (A, C, D, E, K, B vitamins)
  - Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc)

**Trackable Nutrients:**

NutriNova enables tracking for all the macronutrients and micronutrients listed above. As the platform evolves, more nutrients and nutritional components may be added to the trackable list.

### **Progress Monitoring and Reporting**

NutriNova provides various tools to visualize and analyze progress towards nutritional goals:

- **Progress Indicators**: Visual cues indicate whether a user is on track to meet, has met, or has exceeded their daily target for each nutrient.
- **Detailed Goal Views**: Users can access in-depth information about individual goals, including target values, historical progress, and statistics on how consistently they're meeting the goal.
- **Reports**: NutriNova generates comprehensive reports that summarize nutritional intake and goal progress over specified periods (daily, weekly, monthly). These reports offer valuable insights into dietary patterns and help users make informed decisions about their nutritional choices.
